# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite. It utilizes shadcn/ui components (built on Radix UI) for a consistent and accessible design, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for server state management. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS. The application follows a page-based routing structure with dedicated sections for Dashboard, Time Entry, Time Log, Projects, Tasks, Employees, Departments, and Organizations, all incorporating role-based authentication and permission checks. A robust role-based access control system is implemented with `useAuth`, `usePermissions`, `useRole` hooks, `ProtectedRoute`, `RoleGuard` components, and a role-aware `UserMenu`.

## Backend Architecture
The backend uses Express.js with a RESTful API design featuring enhanced database resilience and connection management. It includes a modular structure with separate files for route handlers, database operations (abstracted via a storage interface), database connection with retry logic, and authentication middleware. API endpoints cover user management, project CRUD, time entry management, and dashboard analytics. All routes are protected by authentication middleware with comprehensive error handling.

## Database Schema & Resilience  
The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM and enhanced connection pooling. The schema includes tables for Users, Projects, Time Entries, and Sessions, designed with cascading deletes and indexing for performance. Key resilience features include:
- Connection retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Database health monitoring and circuit breaker patterns  
- Enhanced error handling that prevents server crashes from database connection issues
- Connection pool error recovery with graceful degradation

## Authentication & Authorization System
The system integrates Replit OIDC via Passport.js for authentication, utilizing PostgreSQL-backed session storage with a 7-day TTL and automatic user profile synchronization. Authorization is handled through a four-tier Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system (Admin, Manager, Employee, Viewer) with granular permissions. Access control is context-aware, supporting department and organization-scoped access. A middleware stack enforces authentication and authorization.

### Role Definitions
- **Admin**: SUPERUSER with unrestricted access to ALL application data from ALL users. Can view, edit, and delete any time entries, employees, projects, departments. Dashboard shows company-wide statistics.
- **Manager**: Department-level management with employee and project oversight.
- **Employee**: Basic project access with personal time tracking capabilities.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to assigned projects and own time entries.

### Permission Categories
Permissions cover projects, time entries, employee management, department/organization management, dashboard/reporting, and system administration.

## State Management
Client-side state is managed using TanStack Query for server state and React's built-in state for UI. It employs optimistic updates and cache invalidation. Form state is handled by React Hook Form with Zod for validation.

## Testing Infrastructure
- **185 Total Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage with 86% pass rate (160/185 passing)
- **Admin Access Tests**: Dedicated admin-superuser.test.ts validates complete superuser permissions
- **Automated CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline with admin access verification
- **Test Categories**: Authentication, API endpoints, component rendering, admin permissions, role-based access
